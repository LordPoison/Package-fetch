# CSC3022F Assignment 4 RL 2025

-Type make to compile and run all the files. 
-Type make filename (with lower case) to run just that file (e.g. scenario1)
-Type make filename (with lower case)-stochastic to run just that file but with the stochastic parameter set to true (e.g. scenario1-stochastic)
-Type make clean to remove all executables and images

Scenario1:
    Is currently using epsilon decay. Contain 2 strategies Boltzmann and epsilon decay. Only one method can be ran at a time. The two methods besides main are for implementing these strategies. The program is meant to print out the path of the agent and a graph for how the strategy performed.

Scenario2:
    Uses Boltzmann. Just creates the path of agent.

Scenario3:
    Uses Boltzmann. Just creates the path of agent.
